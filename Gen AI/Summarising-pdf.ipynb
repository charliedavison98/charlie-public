It is important to have a clear understanding of the overall strategy for the initiative and to identify the key success factors that will be used to evaluate potential providers. The market for service providers is highly fragmented, and it is important to understand the different types of providers that are available and their areas of expertise. Once a shortlist of potential providers has been identified, it is important to engage with them to understand their capabilities and to assess the level of risk involved in working with them. The single most important outcome of the entire process is not about the vendor you select - it's the identification of risk.\n",
